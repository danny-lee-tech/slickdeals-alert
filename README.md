## Future Enhancements/Ideas
* Add other filters other than rank, such as category, reply count or view count
* Add the ability to run multiple filter rules (i.e. one filter to find ranks of 8 or more and one filter to find reply count higher than 10) and combine results in a single notification/email
* Smarter Detection Filters - the idea is that a view count of 700 might not be much around noon, but it is considered a lot at 2AM
